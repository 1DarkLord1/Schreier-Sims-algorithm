# Schreier-Sims-algorithm
Implementation of the Schreier-Sims algorithm. The algorithm works with subgroups of permutation group and can be used for effective order calculation, finding of orbits and stabilizers, checking if the element is the member of group. Algorithm based mainly on the Schreier lemma and the Schreier tree concept.
